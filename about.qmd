# Traveling

I love to travel. I have been able to go to a couple places in Europe with my family (camel photo from Israel), and my best friend and I went to Budapest (architecture photo with water), Vienna (architecture photo), Ios (Island in Greece), and London (horse statue photo) last summer. She is an international student from London, so I got to see where she's from, which was very special. We plan on backpacking through Southeast Asia after we graduate college. I got to study abroad in Costa Rica during fall quarter (waterfall and water scenery photo), and had been there previously for spring break with some friends during the second year of college (zip lining photo), and this year for spring break I went to Hawaii (snorkeling photo), where one of my housemates lives.

# Concerts

I love concerts. I listen to music a lot, and am really into EDM, particularly house music and dub step. I love shows that have bright visuals and laser beam lights. I went to Sziget festival in Budapest (first photo), Reading in London (second photo), and saw Dom Dolla (third photo) last summer. I saw Excision in February (rainbow face photo), just recently went to Lightening in a Bottle festival (group photo), and I plan on going to Same Same but Different festival in September. I went to Outsidelands (last photo) in San Francisco a couple of years ago. I love music festivals and concerts because the community is so welcoming and friendly, and everyone loves to chat and make new friends. Seeing music live has to be one of the best things life has to offer.

# Friends

I'm really lucky to have a wonderful support system. I'm very close with my high school friend group, and I see them as often as possible (first photo). My best friend is my roommate, and for one of her birthday gifts I got her a two person hoodie for us to wear (second photo). The third photo was a candid capture of us agreeing we're going to split the dessert in front of us. I live in a house with six girls including me and her, and we have some other friends that come over a lot (fourth and sixth photo). I am still really close with my study abroad friends (fifth photo), and I'm lucky that quite a few of them go to UCSB.
