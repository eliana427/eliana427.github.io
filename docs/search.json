    "text": "Research Paper - Inspiration and Summary\nWhen I was in Costa Rica, I studied the abundance of blood parasites present in bats from different research. I’m very interested in how diseases transfer from animal to human populations, which commonly happens by the way of bats because they are disease vectors. That means that they can carry the disease and spread it, but because of the unique features they evolved throughout time they themselves are not affected by the disease. Although I wasn’t able to study the transfer of diseases from animals to humans, it was very fascinating to see how bats from different areas contain more or less parasites.\nI conducted the study by capturing bats via mist netting and butterfly nets (read paper for more information). Once I caught the bats, I pricked an accessible vein on their left foot with a needle to draw a little bit of blood. I collected the blood on a slide and made a thin blood smear, and the next day in the lab used Giemsa stain to make the sample more clear to view under the microscope. For each of my 18 samples, I carefully inspected each slide and counted the number of parasites.\nView PDF in new tab\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{shandalov2025,\n  author = {Shandalov, Eliana},\n  title = {Research {Paper} {Sample}},\n  date = {2025-06-01},\n  url = {https://eliana427.github.io/posts/paperpost/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nShandalov, Eliana. 2025. “Research Paper Sample.” June 1,\n2025. https://eliana427.github.io/posts/paperpost/."

    "text": "In this chunk of code, I was recreating a graph from an example. The graph represents the total monthly rain fall (represented on the x-axis) categorized by year in Isla Vista. My code begins with referencing a cleaned data set, and I created a line graph using ggplot where I specified what variables I wanted on each of my axes, how I wanted my data to be grouped, and that I wanted each group to be a different color. I then changed the colors of each of the lines from the default to match the example image. I found the exact colors to use by searching up an R studio list of colors. I then edited the names of my axes and legend to make the graph clear, and added a title. To make the graph look more organized and pleasing to the eye, I removed the background noise including grid lines and axes ticks. I changed the placement of the legend to be placed inside the plot, and I changed the size and alignment of the title."

    "text": "Traveling\nI love to travel. I have been able to go to a couple places in Europe with my family (camel photo from Israel), and my best friend and I went to Budapest (architecture photo with water), Vienna (architecture photo), Ios (Island in Greece), and London (horse statue photo) last summer. She is an international student from London, so I got to see where she’s from, which was very special. We plan on backpacking through Southeast Asia after we graduate college. I got to study abroad in Costa Rica during fall quarter (waterfall and water scenery photo), and had been there previously for spring break with some friends during the second year of college (zip lining photo), and this year for spring break I went to Hawaii (snorkeling photo), where one of my housemates lives.\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerts\nI love concerts. I listen to music a lot, and am really into EDM, particularly house music and dub step. I love shows that have bright visuals and laser beam lights. I went to Sziget festival in Budapest (first photo), Reading in London (second photo), and saw Dom Dolla (third photo) last summer. I saw Excision in February (rainbow face photo), just recently went to Lightening in a Bottle festival (group photo), and I plan on going to Same Same but Different festival in September. I went to Outsidelands (last photo) in San Francisco a couple of years ago. I love music festivals and concerts because the community is so welcoming and friendly, and everyone loves to chat and make new friends. Seeing music live has to be one of the best things life has to offer.\n     \n\n\nFriends\nI’m really lucky to have a wonderful support system. I’m very close with my high school friend group, and I see them as often as possible (first photo). My best friend is my roommate, and for one of her birthday gifts I got her a two person hoodie for us to wear (second photo). The third photo was a candid capture of us agreeing we’re going to split the dessert in front of us. I live in a house with six girls including me and her, and we have some other friends that come over a lot (fourth and sixth photo). I am still really close with my study abroad friends (fifth photo), and I’m lucky that quite a few of them go to UCSB."
