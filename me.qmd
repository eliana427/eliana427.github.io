# Everything happens for a reason

I believe that everything happens for a reason.

# Only take to heart what is in my control

There is no reason to be upset about things beyond my own control

# Maybe they're just having a bad day

If someone is mean to you, they might have something going on in their own life that caused that and it isn't personal.

# Embarrassment is a choice

You might as well laugh at yourself instead of feeling embarrassed.
