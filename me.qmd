# Healthy Mindset = Happy Life

## Everything happens for a reason

I believe that everything happens for a reason. It allows me to live my life freely and release expectations that don't serve me. I apply this to small things and larger things. I used to have trouble with this, but through life experience I have been able to view things that have happened to me as part of the recipe that makes me who I am. It also helps me realize that everything will work out how it's supposed to, and there's no question about it. This has a lot to do with my spirituality.

## Only take to heart what is in my control

There is no reason to be upset about things beyond my own control. The only actions I can control are my own; it's okay to be upset about things, but it's important to regulate that as well. A lot of the time, the situation is the situation, and if there's absolutely nothing I can do about it then it doesn't deserve my mental energy.

## Maybe they're just having a bad day

If someone is rude to you, they might have something going on in their own life that caused that and it isn't personal. This sentiment allows me to protect my peace and keep living my life the way I want to live it. I experience bad moods too and although I try to not let that negatively impact the people around me (whether people I know or people I cross in short encounters), it's an inevitable part of being a human that we have to acknowledge and accept. Coming from a place of understanding will always make me feel better than judging.

## Embarrassment is a choice

You might as well laugh at yourself instead of feeling embarrassed. I used to be a very shy and awkward kid, until I realized that when you mess up, it's always a great opportunity for a joke. It's never worth over thinking something "embarrassing" because it probably seemed worse to you than it did to the people that witnessed it. And who knows-- maybe I really am embarrassing myself all the time and not viewing it that way. But having negative feelings toward myself would never make the situation better, and I like making people laugh anyway.
