## Description

In this chunk of code, I was recreating a graph from an example. The graph represents the total monthly rain fall (represented on the x-axis) categorized by year in Isla Vista. My code begins with referencing a cleaned data set, and I created a line graph using ggplot where I specified what variables I wanted on each of my axes, how I wanted my data to be grouped, and that I wanted each group to be a different color. I then changed the colors of each of the lines from the default to match the example image. I found the exact colors to use by searching up an R studio list of colors. I then edited the names of my axes and legend to make the graph clear, and added a title. To make the graph look more organized and pleasing to the eye, I removed the background noise including grid lines and axes ticks. I changed the placement of the legend to be placed inside the plot, and I changed the size and alignment of the title.
